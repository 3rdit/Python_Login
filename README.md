# Python_Login

simple python login user interface with a couple decent things i added
made for fun + i need to learn python for school stuff

features:
*login works completely fine (offline login)
*equipped with a dead datboi meme as the icon of it
*comes with a "custom_textentry" class that creates an entry field with whatever width/height

i don't personally give one if you want to use it and modify it/fork the entire project thats fine by me as this 
didn't really take long to make and isn't even that high level of a project
